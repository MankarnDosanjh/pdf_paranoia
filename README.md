pdf_encrypter.py crawls through a directory and encrypts all PDF files with a supplied password.

pdf_decrypter.py is similar, except it decrypts.

Supports command line functionality however I do not know how to get past PATH length limits, so I have a note on how to get that set up and where to put files to avoid those errors.

There are no PATH length issues when using it normally.

It will save PDF files with a tag such as _encrypted or _decrypted depending on which script was used.
