# Usage

Both scripts will prompt you for a folder which should include PDF files. They will then prompt you for a password.

**"pdf_encrypter.py"** will encrypt those PDF files with that password, if they are not already encrypted.

**"pdf_encrypter.py"** will attempt to decrypt those PDF files with that password, if they are not already decrypted. If decryption fails it will display an error message.
